Neovim config files.

See init.lua, everything starts from there.

See setup.sh for how this repo can be used (there are some setup steps,
mainly, the lua files need to be made available under a `lua` folder for
Neovim to pick them up).

The config is mostly geared towards Go, Terraform, Lua and JavaScript/Vue,
which is what I use most, however there are about a dozen+ of LSPs setup,
plus TreeSitter and auto format via Prettier for all the filetypes it supports.
Those three combined should give quite a decent support for many filetypes.
